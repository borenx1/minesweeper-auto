2. Keep the Minesweeper window in the forefront, this will allow the script to "see" the grid
3. To auto-play Minesweeper, click on the "Analysis Window" to focus it and press the keyboard button "a", this will turn auto-play mode on (see bottom right of Analysis Window)
4. The script will keep playing until there are no more 100% moves. You may need to click on random squares to open up possible moves. Not every game is 100% winnable, you may need to play a few games to win, the win rate depends on the difficulty.
5. End the script forcefully (Ctrl-C) to end the script.
